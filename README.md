# Liver Disease Prediction Web Application

Welcome to the Liver Disease Prediction Web Application project repository! This Flask-based web application predicts the likelihood of liver disease based on user input parameters such as age, gender, and various biochemical markers.
## Overview
Liver disease is a significant health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective management and treatment. This web application aims to provide users with a convenient tool for assessing their risk of liver disease and encouraging timely medical consultation if necessary.

## Features

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for entering user information.<br/>
Predictive Model: Utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on synthetic data to predict the likelihood of liver disease.<br/>
Immediate Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to users based on the prediction result, along with a recommendation to consult a doctor if liver disease is suspected.<br/>
Scalability: Built on Flask, allowing for easy scalability and potential integration with other healthcare-related features in the future.<br/>

## Usage

To use the Liver Disease Prediction Web Application:<br/>

1.Access the application through the web browser.<br/>
2.Fill out the form with your age, gender, and relevant biochemical markers.<br/>
3.Submit the form to receive a prediction regarding the likelihood of liver disease.<br/>

## Technologies Used
Flask: Python-based web framework for building the backend server.<br/>
HTML/CSS: Frontend design and layout.<br/>
JavaScript: For frontend interactivity (if applicable).<br/>
NumPy: Used for numerical computing and handling arrays.<br/>
scikit-learn: Implements the SVM model for prediction.<br/>
Heroku (optional): Deployment platform for hosting the application online.<br/>
